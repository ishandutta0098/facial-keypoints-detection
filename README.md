# Facial Keypoints Detection

Deep Learning Models for Facial Keypoints Detection.

## About the Data

The dataset has been taken from the Kaggle Competition [Facial Keypoints Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection). 
  
The objective of this task is to predict keypoint positions on face images. This can be used as a building block in several applications, such as:
  
- tracking faces in images and video
- analysing facial expressions
- detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis
- biometrics / face recognition

## Methods

1. Baseline Model - ResNet50 with pretrained weights
2. Post Training Quantization
